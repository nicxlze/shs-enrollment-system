                <h1>KNOWING OUR PATRON SAINT: ST. ALPHONSUS DE LIGUORI</h1>
                <p>
                    Born on the 27th of September 1686 in Naples, Italy, St. Alphonsus was destined to be a priest. His father Joseph Liguori, was a navy officer while his mother, Anna Caterina a pious woman, stayed home as a housewife. They expected their children to commit themselves to any of these vocations: law, military, and religion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At 17, St. Alphonsus became a brilliant lawyer. He worked for the sick and the poor. It was at this time that he was called by God to enter the priesthood. Upon committing to his call, he noticed that poverty kept the poor away from the church. This moved him to establish the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer. This congregation was an order of missionary priests whose devotion was focused on apostolic work among the poor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was crippled for life when a major illness struck him, but this did not stop him from continuing his service to the poor. He was also dedicated to writing poems and essays on theological subjects. He was canonized in 1839 and declared Patron Saint of Confessors and Moralist in 1950. His feast day is celebrated every first day of August.

                <h1>BRIEF HISTORY OF ST. ALPHONSUS LIGUORI INTEGRATED SCHOOL</h1>
                <p>
                    St. Alphonsus Liguori Integrated School was established in 1991 to serve the fast-growing population of Molino, Bacoor, Cavite. It was founded by six teachers who had spent long years of service in an exclusive girls' school in Manila. These teachers, who were active in education advocacy through NGO work, decided to set up a model of their ideal school in Molino. Four supporters joined and provided technical and financial assistance. Faculty members and staff from the same exclusive girls' school joined the growing school later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The founders initially offered preschool education in a rented two-room house. Two of them, assisted by two teachers and a staff member, managed the school, which started with 55 pre-schoolers. In its second year, Grades I-4 courses were opened as a response to the clamor of parents who initiated a signature campaign to appeal to school management and DepEd officials for additional grade levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next years were difficult for the new school with very meager resources but the faculty and staff faced the challenge creatively and dedicatedly. Fees were maintained at a reasonable level to continue giving access to students who deserve quality education at low cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1996, DepEd granted the school a Certificate of Recognition having passed all the criteria and requirements for an Elementary Course. On its 10th Foundation Year, the Secondary Course was opened to finally complete the school's Basic Education Program. On its 15th year, SALIS, having passed the quality standards set by the Fund for Assistance to Private Education (FAPE) won financial subsidy for its High School students starting on SY 2005-06 under the Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education (GASTPE) Program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Significant reforms were introduced in the Philippine Education System with the passing of Republic Act 10533 known as the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013. Briefly, it mandated the inclusion of one year of Kindergarten to the formal system and added 2 years Senior High School to Secondary Education. It also made for reaching changes in the design and details of the Basic Education Curriculum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having passed the requirements of the Department of Education, SALIS was given permission to offer Senior High School beginning SY 2016-17. The ESC subsidy continues to be enjoyed by the Grades 11-12 students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the threshold of the 21th Century, the school moves on conscious of the profound challenges of the new era. A paradigm shift has to be made in its service to keep up with the advances in technology, information explosion and globalization. A very important issue. which the school wants to address, is the assertion of the Filipino identity and national sovereignty as the Philippines co-exist with the rich and industrialized countries in the free market of a borderless world economy. Given these realities, what kind of education shall the school give its students to be globally competitive? Indeed, the problems of the Philippines as a developing nation remain the same, but the playing field is different.
